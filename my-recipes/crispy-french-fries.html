        <p>My family loves seasoned fries and with 4 children the bag of fries from the store became too expensive. So I tried batter — after all, it makes chicken, shrimp, and onion rings crispy so why not potatoes! 
            Now even my husband can't get enough of these French fries. They even stay crispy when you reheat them in the microwave.</p>
